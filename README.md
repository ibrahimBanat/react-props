In this very simple application, i built a user interface using react, this user interface include a commnets and approval cards for a blog post. the main reason for this repo is to practice and understand the communcation between components using react object _`props`_

## Application Overview

- In this application I used and applied three concepts:

  1. Component nesting .
  2. Component resuability.
  3. Component configuration.

- Concepts details
  - Naive component approach & specifying images in JSX.
  - Extracting JSX to a new component & component nesting.
  - React props system & passing multiple props.
  - component reuse and showing custom children.
